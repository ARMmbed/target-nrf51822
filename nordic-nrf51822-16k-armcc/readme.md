## yotta Target Description using ARMCC to compile for Nordic nRF51822 16KB device.

Please note that the Nordic S130 Softdevice HEX file is missing from this
target. Builds using this target will fail unless the softdevice is available.
We are doing our best to obtain permission to distribute the Softdevice; but
until that time users of this target will be required to download and install
the softdevice into a particular location manually. Instructions for doing
this can be found at `softdevice/DOWNLOADING_SOFTDEVICE.txt`.
